# Analyzing At-risk Populations: COVID-19 & Misinformation 
- brief intro and graphic 

# Organizational Objective 
Curtailing the spread of misinformation is critical to combatting the mass spread of illness and disease. 
This analysis presents findings concerning misinformed beliefs about COVID-19. The reccomendations of this project can be utilized by organizations like the CDC to target at risk groups with evidence based information, ahead of future outbreaks of illness and diseases. 

# Main Findings 
I analyzed survey data from the American National Electioon Study's Pilot Exploraory Testing Survey from April 2020. The survey garnered over 3,000 responses to questions spanning topics from feminisim, to the 2020 election and to COVID-19. My analysis found that the following beliefs are strongly related to holding misinformed opinions about COVID-19: 
  1. X
  2. X
  3. X
  4. X
  5. X

# Notebooks 
The notebook titled "main" includes all EDA, data cleaning and modeling required to understand the analysis. 

# Data Cleaning 
The csv filed labeled "anes_pilot_2020.csv" is the primary data source for this project. The dataset included responses to all 470 survey questions. In addition to questions that fielded public opinion, the questions also asked respondents for demographic information which included but is not limited to: self-reported political ideology, self-reportedd party identification, self-reported ethno/racial identification, sex, age, education level, location of residencey and income. I engineered a targeet variable labeled "covid_mis_score" which is a 0 to 2 point scale for misinformation about COVID-19. I created this variable by combining responses from two questions which asked about vaccines and the origin of the novel virus.
